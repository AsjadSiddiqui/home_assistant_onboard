# Home Assistant Onboard (Demo App)
 ## For now, this is a Flutter+Firebase Demo App to demonstrate Firebase Privacy Extension
The Home Assistant Scheduler is a proof of concept, expands upon my [Udacity AI Nanodegree Capstone](https://github.com/stigsfoot/Udacity-Nanodegrees/tree/master/Machine%20Learning/capstone). This Flutter app demonstrates a manual flow for a homeowner to log installation dates and maintenance items in a home (internal/external) and be able to purge that data from the system permanently when they need to.

## 3 core objectives

**Authenticate** - Firebase Auth (Email/Google/Anonym)

**Onboarding** - Via the Flutter UI, select their preferences for home artifacts inside and outside their home theyâ€™d like to track. For example HVAC (last serviced, next service), Roof (date installed, next inspection), etc.

**Deletion** - Leverage Firebase Delete User Data extension (Cloud Firestore paths, Recursive) to honor an authenticated users' request to purge their information.
